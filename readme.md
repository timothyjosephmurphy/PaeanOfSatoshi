Purpose: describe the useage of the github repository https://github.com/timothyjosephmurphy/PaeanOfSatoshi

This is an open-source mythology monumentalizing the origin of Satoshi Nakamoto. 

It is intended to be a work of ficiton that inspires people to overcome darkness and acheive human flourishing. 

The repo contains assets that are offered as seeds for development: a story arc, a set of verses that instantiate it, images that illustrate it, and music that expresses it. 

Many of the assets are sketches created using AI tools, but all of the verses are original, "hand-written" poetry, raw though they may be. My hope is that these thigns will be developed in to finsihed art, performed by one or many performers, in many variations. 

I would like to invite others to contribute. The file "Paean.md" should be considered the current cannon version. It is composed of an introduction and twelve verses, each formed of quatrains of rhyming couplets. Each line is given an index number, of the form "#.#.#". 

Some of the lines are pretty good poetry, a lot of them need work. I would be thrilled to receieve proposals for revisions through a pull request; and modern version control via Github can accomodate any number of branches. 

My ultimate vision for this project is to create a workflow that develops the seeds from the verses into finished pieces by developing in stages. For example: take verse 1, extend it into a verse-chorus-verse structure, create images that illustrate the concepts, create music that expresses it, and compile these things into a video. Ideally it is a flexible structure that can be altered and recompiled at will, relying on AI tools to produce creative assets. 

The aim is not to pass off the AI-generated assets as finished work, but to use them as sketches for ultimately human-created work, whether it be sung music, physically paintings, or multimedia performances. The ai-sketches can serve as the recepie, and they can be altered to suit varied audiences cultural contexts.

Keeping it short is a desiderata. With 12 verses, made into 2-minute songs, it would amount to a 24-minute production. Much longer than the twitter-era attention span as a whole, but presentable in small, digestible chunks that may each have independant appeal.
